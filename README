Practical Assignment 10 for INFS3202 at the University of Queensland

Description:
    A university course information system implemented in JSP with MySQL connectivity.
    The focus of this project was to implement a course scheduling algorithm to 
    minimize clashes. I took a naive approach to the algorithm and a very inefficient 
    way of dealing with database connections. It is a proof of concept--that I am able
    to design and program a complex information system requiring database connectivity,
    authentication and automation. We had a choice of JSP or PHP and I chose JSP
    because I am partial to Java and believe experience with web programming in a Java
    environment is more sought-after in industry.
    
    I was unable to complete parts 3b and 4b of the design specification but was still
    awarded full marks for the amount of skill and understanding I demonstrated.
